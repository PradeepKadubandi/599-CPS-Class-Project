# Work items
- Real World Scenario (Rittwik)
  - Generate a shape file from USC parking lot and convert to a cost map file
  - Add some cars into the above map either before or after generating the cost map (whichever is easier), so costmap should also include cars
  - test the end to end example using the above cost map.
  - If the above works without too many issues, check all the artifacts into a folder in this repository. Otherwise, we need to discuss if it requires a lot of work.

- Complex car model (Jessy)
  - Convert the HelperVehicleSimulator to use vehicle width (2 dimensional model).
  - Run the existing example end to end and if works, check in the new files/modifications in this folder.
  - If there are too many issues, again we need to discuss.

- Find out more work items (Pradeep)
  - Open ended
